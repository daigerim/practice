You're never gonna make it, you're not good enough
There's a million other people with the same stuff
You really think you're different? Man you must be kidding
Think you're gonna hit it, but you just don't get it
It's impossible, it's not probable
You're irresponsible, too many obstacles
You gotta stop it yo, you gotta take it slow
You can't be a pro, don't waste your time no more
Who the fuck are you to tell me what to do?
I don't give a damn if you say you disapprove
I'm gonna make my move, I'm gonna make it soon
And I'll do it 'cause it's what I want to fucking do
'Cause all these opinions and all these positions
They coming in millions, they're blocking your vision
But no, you can't listen, that shit is all fiction
'Cause you hold the power as long as you're driven
